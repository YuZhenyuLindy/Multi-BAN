## Abstract

Adversarial learning has achieved great success for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Existing adversarial UDA methods leverage the predicted discriminative information with Nuclear-norm Wasserstein discrepancy for feature alignment. However, the limited memory space makes it very difficult to accurately calculate the Nuclear-norm, which hinders domain adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose the multi-batch Nuclear-norm adversarial network, termed as MBAN. Specifically, we build a dynamic queue to cache feature, which encourages to generate a large and consistent output matrix, enabling accurately calculating the Nuclear-norm. Then, the multi-batch Nuclear-norm discrepancy is proposed, which can effectively improve the transferability and discriminability of the learned features. Experimental results show that MBAN could achieve significant performance improvement, especially when the number of categories is quite large.
